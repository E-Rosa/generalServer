Task: Change the constructor in the ClassModel class
to make it so that the date goes in the format of
a string to the front-end, like YYYY-MO-DA

The date comes from the DB like:
2000-08-20T03:00:00.000Z

I want the data to go to the front-end like:
2000-08-20

I want to receive the data from the front-end like:
2000-08-20

I want to update the data on my database like:
2000-08-20

The API cycle:
	To get data:
		0.The front-end requests the data.
		1.The controller uses the repository to query the db >
		2.The controller uses the model to generate instances
			of a class formatted for the front-end.
		3.The controller sends the data to the front-end

	To receive data: 
		0. The front-end sends the data
		1. The controller uses the model to generate
			instances of a class formatted for the back-end
		2.The controller uses the repository to query the db
		3.The controller sends a status to the front-end.
